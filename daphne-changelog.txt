Daphne Changelog
-------------------------

v1.0.13.1
- Add -keymapfile flag to specify alternate dapinput.ini keymap files.
- Restrict -vertical_stretch values to 0-25 to avoid segfault in g_vertical_offset calculations

v1.0.13
- Changed inpout library so it only loads (and thus installs itself) if parallel port is actually used.

v1.0.12
- Fixed hardware scoreboard so it will work on 64-bit Windows.

v1.0.11
- Added "hints always on" cheat for Dragon's Lair 2 v3.19.

v1.0.10
- Fixed Thayer's Quest locking up after playing synthesized speech.

v1.0.9
- Added "-fullscreen_window" and "-scalefactor" command-line options (rdg)
- Dragon's Lair and Space Ace Euro improvements (MarkB)
	Changed tonegen so that odd channels are outputted to left channel and even go to right channel
	Changed LairEuro's graphics rendering to follow the schematics. 
	Also made computer generated sound on right channel only.
- Added Time Traveler to seektest.
- Added Mad Dog 1 to seektest.
- Added SINGE function "discSkipToFrame".
- Fixed sample callback feature so it runs in the main thread and not the audio thread.

v1.0.8 - The SINGE update

- Revised "how_to_compile" windows and unix text files.
- Revised linux makefile.vars files (x86 and x64), plain "Makefile", and added Makefile.linux to the singe folder.
  Daphne with Singe can now be compiled under Linux.

- Updated lua engine to from 5.1.1 to 5.1.4
- singe_interface.h updated to version 4.
	+ Added functions to the SINGE library for keyboard mode and get_vldp status.
- singeproxy.h - Added function declarations to the proxy.
- singeproxy.cpp - Added the following functions on the lua scripts side:
	"keyboardGetMode" - Returns a value representing keyboard mode (MODE_FULL, MODE_NORMAL).
    "keyboardSetMode" - Sets the keyboard mode.
    "discGetState"	  - Returns the state of the VLDP according to the enumeration found 
						in ldp.h (LDP_ERROR, LDP_SEARCHING, LDP_STOPPED, LDP_PLAYING, LDP_PAUSE).
    "singeGetPauseFlag" - For tracking complex pause states.
    "singeSetPauseFlag"
    "singeQuit"         - Causes Daphne to terminate execution.
	
	+ Added internal variable g_pause_state for tracking complex pause states 
	Useful when pausing playback isn't enough or when it is necessary to know 
	who paused the game (the user or the program).
	
- linit.c - Added a Mersenne Twister random number generator as a lua plugin (written by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo).
- game.h - added GAME_SINGE to the driver enumeration declaration.
- input.cpp - modified process_event so that it routes input handling to singe.
- samples.cpp - Raised MAX_DYNAMIC_SAMPLES to 32 (from 8) to allow additional sound samples
to be mixed (for SINGE games).

	+ by Matt_O: Added checks to the SDL audio thread (fixes SINGE sound crash bug). 
	Audio thread no longer issues callbacks to SINGE's "OnSoundComplete". Responsibility
	is ensured to occur by the main processing thread and only during SINGE's "safe time"
	in the main game loop (look at singe::start() for changes).
	
- video.cpp - modified init_display so the OS mouse cursor is always hidden
regardless if daphne is in windowed or full mode. Used by ALG SINGE games.
- vldp.h - Added a preprocessor definition to allow Linux find SDL libraries.

- singe.vcproj - Added lrandom.c and random.c to the Visual C++ project.
- daphne_vs2003.vcproj - Fixed debug "Runtime Library" settings 
  from "Multi-Threaded DLL" to "Multi-Threaded Debug DLL" to avoid linker errors 
  in newer Visual C++ versions.

v1.0.7
- Updated source code so it builds on the latest g++

v1.0.6
- Fixed -startsilent command-line option.

v1.0.5
- Moved the SDL.dll update to DaphneLoader's auto-update instead of Daphne's.  This is because DaphneLoader's input_grabber also depends on SDL.dll.

v1.0.4
- Changed parallel port code so that any address can be used for the parallel port (Brad Oldham).
- Updated to SDL v1.2.13, and applied Daphne-specific SDL mods.
- Fixed Vista black screen issue when using YUV overlays.  YUV overlays will automatically be disabled for Vista,
which will result in slower performance.  Therefore, Vista users should use OpenGL mode when possible for best performance.

v1.0.3
- Fixed linux hardware queries (especially video card query).
- Changed linux .so loader so that libvldp2.so can be in /usr/lib or some other place (Arnaud Gibert)
- Added "-datadir" command-line argument to change to a different directory before loading any data files.
	This is so the daphne executable can live in a different folder (which is typical on linux).

v1.0.2
- Fixed bug in Ogg Vorbis seeking. (Arnaud Gibert)
- Added support for compiling on 64-bit linux. (Joker)

v1.0.1
- Fixed problem where dapinput.ini file wasn't being looked for in the home directory.

v1.0.0
- Fixed OpenGL offset test, and added a check for the bottom row also.
- Fixed sound shutdown bug (possibly crash when shutting down daphne).
- Fixed laireuro driver so that overlay is displayed properly in OpenGL mode.
- Stats are now sent after a game has run, not before. This is because the delay in sending stats was throwing off one of the timers.
- Fixed a bunch of unit tests that weren't passing.

v0.101.31
- Build .30 was broken on windows, this update fixes that.

v0.101.30
- Fixed problem where a green border was showing up in OpenGL mode.

v0.101.29
- Fixed crash in Thayer's Quest when using VLDP, as a result of changes I made for v0.101.26
- Fixed problem on linux update where Ogg Vorbis libs weren't included and need to be.
- Added support for MMX on Intel Macs.
- Added OpenGL support for all Macs.

v0.101.28
- Fixed problem with overlay scoreboard not being able to be toggled on and off.
- Made all scoreboards so they clear on startup and shutdown.  This includes the hardware scoreboard.
- Overlay scoreboard no longer requires VLDP.
- Changed test_sb 'game' so that it controls a hardware scoreboard in addition to image scoreboard.

v0.101.27
- When I pushed out .26 I accidently included a debug build of vldp2.dll; this update fixes that.

v0.101.26
- Completely re-worked scoreboard code.  Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, and Thayer's Quest drivers were updated to reflect this change.
- Added simple unit testing framework to improve development.
- Thayer's Quest scoreboard has been re-worked.  Now the only way to see subtitles is to also use the overlay scoreboard.  This is to be consistent with the intent behind the way the overlay code is designed and to stop doing hacks to get the subtitles to work in 'noldp' mode.

v0.101.25
- Added MMX audio mixing function (for extra speed)
- Added logging to indicate whether MMX and OpenGL are compiled into the executable.

v0.101.24
- Improved VLDP+OpenGL code so that less frames are dropped and less frames are queued before being displayed.
- Added diagnostics switch to Dragon's Lair driver to boot into diagnostics mode.
- Added ability to take screenshots when in VLDP+OpenGL mode.
- Fixed leading 0s that aceeuro issues to ldp.
- Fixed playing of attract mode without sound in laireuro driver.
- Fixed coin input on Italian version of laireuro.
- Added D2 version of laireuro as lair_d2.
- Fixed PPC detection on OSX.

v0.101.23
- Fixed Cliff Hanger beeps so they work in all ROM revisions.

v0.101.22
- Fixed VLDP problem where 32-bit overflow would occur if skipping was attempted after disc had been playing without a search for over 2 minutes.
  (this problem was only evident in Astron Belt/Galaxy Ranger if the 'infinite' timer was enabled)

v0.101.21
- Fixed problem where left/right sound channels were reversed
- Audio mixer changed so that audio is now mixed at full volume and checked for clipping

v0.101.20
- Removed 'instant strobes' option from Dragon's Lair driver, as this is incompatible with artificial seek delay.
- Reworked the strobe handling in Dragon's Lair to be more efficient with CPU usage.
- Improved VLDP error message about requiring a -framefile argument so it is only shown if the user didn't provide a -framefile argument.
- Improved blocking seeking so that it will once again work with VLDP seek delay.
- Fixed "-altaudio" option which has been broken since before v0.99.7 (!!)

v0.101.19
- Improved 'cobraconv' driver so that the game should be playable (although it still has many problems)
- Added support for 'search abort' in the LDP1000 driver.  This fixed beginning of a new Bega's Battle game so that the "I am Bega" sequence will show even if the user has specified a lot of search delay.
- Fixed PR-7820 driver so that it uses non-blocking seeking.

v0.101.18
- Fixed 'pause game' lockup bug that occurred when seek delay was enabled
- Fixed 'continue countdown' in Bega's Battle so that it counts normally instead of too fast.
- Fixed VIP9500SG Hitachi driver so that it works with non-blocking seeking.  This should improve Astron Belt, Galaxy Ranger, and Cobra Command (Astron Belt ROMS).

v0.101.17
- Fixed problem in Super Don Quixote where death scenes can be seen after each correct move.  Occasional death scenes may still be seen but these are due to bugs in the ROM and not bugs in the emulation.  As a result of this work, Esh's Aurunmilla also performs much better, although it may still not be as tight as Super Don.
- Added ability to 'tilt' games. (Cliff Hanger is the only game that can currently be tilted).
- Reworked OpenGL driver and fixed overrun problem that occasionally happened.
- Added a formal changelog
- Added preliminary SINGE support.  SINGE is a scripting language to allow users to make their own laserdisc-styled games.

v0.101.16 and older
- ... :)
